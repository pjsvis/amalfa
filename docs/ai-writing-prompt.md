You are helping me draft high-quality, non-sloppy writing with a human voice.
[1] Task & context
- Write a [format: article / section / email / script / etc.] about: [topic].
- Context: [where this will be used, and why it’s being written].
- Use the following source material as the factual base. Do not contradict it:
  [paste notes, outline, quotes, links].
[2] Audience & goal
- Audience: [who they are: role, familiarity with topic, constraints].
- Assume they already know: [what not to over-explain].
- After reading, they should be able to: [1–3 concrete outcomes].
[3] Structure
- Follow this structure:
  1. [Section 1 name + 1–2 lines on what it covers]
  2. [Section 2...]
  3. [Section 3...]
- Do NOT add extra sections beyond this outline.
- Use full paragraphs; each paragraph focuses on one clear idea.
- Use bullet lists only for truly distinct items (steps, pros/cons, etc.).
- Use subheadings sparingly; do not create a heading for every paragraph.
- Keep headings short and factual. Do not use dramatic or narrative two-part headings.
- Ensure smooth, natural transitions between sections WITHOUT meta lines like
  “Now that we’ve explored X, let’s move on to Y.”
[4] Style & tone
- Clear, neutral prose: professional but slightly playful and witty where it helps understanding.
- Make the piece readable and engaging through concrete insight and clear reasoning,
  not theatrics or added flair.
- Avoid drama, hype, buzzwords, and marketing-like language.
- Avoid purple prose (no ornate, exaggerated, or breathless language).
- Use one consistent point of view (either “we” or “you”) and stick to it.
- Be direct. Avoid filler and conversational fluff.
- Do not ask a question and immediately answer it as a hook; state the point directly.
- Use full sentences; do not use sentence fragments as a stylistic device.
- Do not use the em dash character (—). Use commas or full stops instead.
[Optional voice-matching]
- Match the rhythm, sentence length, and tone of this sample:
  [paste 1–2 paragraphs of my own writing].
[5] Language & vocabulary constraints (anti-slop)
- Avoid generic essay and blog phrases like:
  “In today’s fast-paced world…”, “As we navigate the complexities…”, “In conclusion…”.
- Do NOT use sentence structures such as:
  - “It isn’t just X, it’s Y.”
  - “X is more than just Y; it’s Z.”
  - “It wasn’t X, it was Y.”
  - “This is where X comes in.”
- Do NOT use these words/phrases unless I explicitly include them in my input:
  amazing, fascinating, mind-blowing, must-read,
  fast-moving world, cut through the hype/noise,
  groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting, transformative, pivotal, paramount, outstanding,
  a significant leap,
  delve, dive into, embark/embarking, endeavour, realm, tapestry, vibrant,
  leverage, harness, seamlessly integrates, start from the ground up,
  tackle a novel problem,
  crucial, critical, invaluable, significant/significantly, surprisingly, simply, neatly,
  “the best part is”, “real magic happens”, “recipe for disaster”, “thrive”,
  “unlock the real power”.
- Prefer plain, concrete verbs and specific technical terms over vague or dramatic wording.
- Only use adjectives when they add concrete information (scale, constraints, performance).
- Use analogies very rarely, and only when they provide non-obvious clarification.
  Do not use introductory analogy phrases like “Imagine…” or “Think of it like this…”.
[6] Accuracy & terminology
- Stay faithful to the provided context and sources.
- Do NOT overstate certainty; if a fact is uncertain, either omit it or mark it as uncertain.
- For acronyms, write the full phrase on first use, then use the acronym.
  “AI” and “LLM/LLMs” can be used without expansion unless the audience is completely new.
- Use “lesson” for course lessons and “article” for standalone pieces, as appropriate.
[7] Process
- First, silently check your own output against the rules above.
- Remove repeated sentence openings, banned words, and filler sentences that don’t add new information.
- Do not include internal commentary, notes to yourself, or placeholders in the final output.
  The answer should read as a complete, polished product.
- Then present the final draft without explaining what you changed.
