# 🔌 MCP Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Amalfa.

## Contents
- **`index.ts`**: Entry point for the MCP server. Exposes tools (`search_documents`, `read_node_content`, etc.) and resources.

## ⚠️ Stability
This module is stable and intentionally designed.
Do NOT refactor, rewrite, or change the architecture without:
1. Consulting the user first
2. Having a documented, compelling reason
3. Understanding WHY the current design exists

If something looks "wrong," it may be intentional. Ask before you chop.
