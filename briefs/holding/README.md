# Holding Area - Briefs Under Review

Briefs in holding are **paused for a reason**:
- Need more research or design work
- Unclear requirements or feasibility
- Waiting for dependencies to mature
- Scope or approach needs reconsideration

**Status:** Not ready for active development. May move to `pending/` when clarified, or `archive/` if abandoned.

## Current Holdings

### Experimental / Research
- **brief-meta-swarm.md** - Model arbitrage/routing (experimental concept)
- **brief-node-dependency-removal.md** - Check if Node deps still exist, what's the scope

### Out of Scope / Needs Scoping
- **brief-factored-bento-layout.md** - UI framework (part of future dashboard work)
- **brief-edinburgh-protocol-contribution-2026-01-13.md** - Documentation contribution (unclear status)

**Review these periodically** - they may become clearer, or may be archived as "not viable."
