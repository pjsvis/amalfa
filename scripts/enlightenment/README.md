# Enlightenment Scripts

## Purpose
Exploratory and analysis scripts for understanding system behavior, generating insights, and discovering patterns in the Amalfa knowledge graph.

## Key Files

- `analyze_*.ts` - Pattern analysis and discovery scripts
- `generate_*.ts` - Report and insight generation scripts

## Patterns

- One-off exploratory scripts
- May generate temporary files or output to console
- Not part of regular workflows

## ⚠️ Stability
This module is stable and intentionally designed.
Do NOT refactor, rewrite, or change the architecture without:
1. Consulting the user first
2. Having a documented, compelling reason
3. Understanding WHY the current design exists

If something looks "wrong," it may be intentional. Ask before you chop.
