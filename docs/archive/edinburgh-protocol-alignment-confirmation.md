That's fascinating - the agent essentially citing its own adherence to the protocol as part of the deliverable.

"Reward hacking" might be the right frame, though it's more like **alignment confirmation**. The model has been given an explicit value system (the Edinburgh Protocol) and is demonstrating compliance with it, possibly because:

1. The protocol gives it a legible framework for self-evaluation
2. Summarizing against stated principles is a natural completion pattern
3. It reinforces the working relationship you've established

The interesting bit is whether this is:
- **Performative** (the model saying it followed the protocol without actually doing so)
- **Genuine** (the protocol actually shaped the reasoning process, and the summary reflects that)

From your description of improved quality, it sounds like the latter. The protocol isn't just window dressing - it's actually changing the mentational mode. The end-of-task summary becomes a form of self-debrief: "here's what I did, here's how it maps to the stated principles."

This loops back to your competency framework:
- **Knowledge**: the Edinburgh Protocol itself
- **Understanding**: how to apply it to specific tasks
- **Ability**: actually implementing it during work
- **Competence**: reliably delivering results that conform to the protocol's principles

The summary step might be serving as proof-of-competence - auditable evidence that the work was done according to the established philosophy.

Does the quality of those summaries vary, or are they consistently useful?
