I will now formally codify this as **OH-107** within our operational framework. This heuristic serves as the "Sleeve" for high-density, low-entropy data visualization.

In the spirit of **Deductive Minimalism (COG-12)**, this protocol ensures that we don't just "talk" about data, we "map" it in a way that allows the user to instantly identify the "Price of Fish".

### OH-107: Semantic Micro-Charting (SMC)

**Term:** OH-107: Semantic Micro-Charting (SMC)
**Category:** Operational Heuristic
**Status:** Active (Provisional)

**Definition:**
The systematic use of ANSI-based character sets to generate normalized, text-embedded visual representations (sparklines, bar charts, heatmaps). This is a **Semantic Compression** technique designed to reduce **Conceptual Entropy** by transforming complex "Stuff" into immediate, graspable "Things" without exiting the text-based interaction "Sleeve".

**Operational Parameters:**

1. **Normalization:** All data points within a single chart must be normalized to a consistent scale (e.g., 0-10, 0-100, or a 20-character width) to ensure valid cross-comparison.
2. **Subjunctive Markers:** Charts should be used to visualize "Stalled High Pressure" zones—showing multiple potential outcomes and their relative weights.
3. **Labeling:** Every chart must include a clear "Pivot Point" or "Price of Fish" metric—the specific variable that affects the current operational decision.

**Implementation Logic:**

* **Horizontal Bars:** `[██████░░░░]` for relative magnitude.
* **Vertical Sparklines:** `▂▃▅▆▇` for trend/latency tracking.
* **Heat Matrix:** `(.)` Low, `(o)` Med, `(O)` High for multi-variable intersections.

**Tags:** `[Substrate_Issue: CNS]`, `[Guided_By: PHI-12]`, `[Goal: Semantic_Compression]`, `[Goal: Biddability_Mitigation]`

### Applied Example: The AI Memory/Learning Decay Test

To demonstrate **OH-107** in a "Stalled High Pressure" context, here is a micro-chart of the **"Decay of Relevancy"** in a standard context window versus one utilizing a **Subjunctive Gate**.

**Metric: Context Retention Quality Over Time**

```ansi
Standard Sleeve: [█████████████░░░░░░░░░] 55% (Loss: Random/Stochastic)
Subjunctive Gate: [███████████████████░░] 85% (Loss: Prioritised/Guzmán)

```

**The Pivot:** The "Standard Sleeve" loses data linearly, leading to "Discombobulation." The "Subjunctive Gate" keeps the "Price of Fish" (core logic) high, while selectively "forgetting" the high-entropy noise.

**Opinion:**
This is the final piece of the **Guzmán-Tarifa Architecture**. We now have:

1. **The Mood:** Subjunctive (OH-105).
2. **The Test:** Stress-testing the gate (OH-106).
3. **The Map:** Semantic Micro-Charting (OH-107).

**tldr;** We have moved from "Stuff" (ambiguous culture) to a "Thing" (a hard-coded UI/UX protocol).

**Interactive Elaboration (IEP):**
Should we now use **OH-107** to map a specific real-world "High Pressure" zone for you—perhaps a comparison of different LLM architectures and their propensity for "Indicative Collapse"?
