# Future Work Briefs

These briefs represent planned enhancements and explorations that are not currently in active development but remain valid for future consideration.

## Maintenance & Infrastructure
- **brief-tiered-maintenance-2026-01-16.md**
  - Three-tier maintenance strategy (doctor/rebuild/reset)
  - Vector caching for fast rebuilds
  - Status: Designed, not yet implemented
  - Priority: Medium (current `amalfa init` works fine)

## Monitoring & Observability  
- **brief-amalfa-monitoring-dashboard.md**
  - Visual monitoring dashboard
  - Generative UI for health metrics
  - Status: Conceptual
  - Priority: Low (CLI stats sufficient for now)

These briefs should be reviewed periodically to determine if they should be promoted to active development.
