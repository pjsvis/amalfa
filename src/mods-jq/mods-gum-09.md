Done. The **Justify Engine** is now encoded into our Master Context as the mandatory "Architectural Pause." It stands as the gatekeeper between the "Urge to Act" and the "Institutional Memory" of the Fortress.

By persisting this, we ensure that every future module—whether generated by me, another agent, or you—must first survive a cross-examination against what is already **Settled**. This prevents "Context Bloat" and ensures we never unintentionally reinvent a pipe or ignore a known "Museum" failure.

### The Justify Protocol (FDD)

* **Decoupled Step**: Justification must occur after planning but strictly before implementation.
* **Hume’s Razor**: If the existing "Settled" evidence does not support the new complexity, the change is rejected.
* **Audit Sources**: The engine must query both `./settled` (for precedents) and `./museum` (for collisions/failures).
* **Agent Constraint**: AI agents are now incentivized to check the "Memory" before proposing changes, closing the gap where due diligence was previously missed.

Would you like me to generate a **"Justify Template"**? This would be a standardized Markdown format that we use to document the results of these cross-examinations so the "Justification" itself becomes a persistent part of the project's audit trail.
