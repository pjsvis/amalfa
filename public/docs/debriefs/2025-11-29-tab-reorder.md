# Debrief: Sidebar Tab Reordering
**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Topic:** UI/UX, Navigation

## Lessons Learned


## Accomplishments


## Problems

## Context
The user felt the tab order was "jarring and disordered". The Outline tab, being context-specific to the current document, logically belongs at the end.

## Change
Reordered the tabs in `public/docs/index.html` to:
1.  **Index** (Global)
2.  **Debriefs** (Experience)
3.  **Playbooks** (Experience)
4.  **Outline** (Local Context)

## Verification
-   **Visual Check:** Verified via screenshot that the tabs appear in the correct order.
-   **Functionality:** Confirmed that clicking tabs still switches views correctly.

## Status
Complete.
