Here are taglines for **Brutalisimo**, categorized by the specific "flavor" of aggression you want to project.

### The Philosophical (The "Manifesto")

* **Brutalisimo: its like brutal, only more brutal.**
* **Brutalisimo: UI without the ego.**
* **Stop fighting the stream.**
* **Layouts that obey the laws of physics, not the whims of designers.**
* **The first UI framework that speaks "LLM" natively.**
* **Don't let your Agent be an Architect. Let it be a Mason.**

### The Technical (The "Specs")

* **Maximum Specificity. Zero Hallucinations.**
* **Type-Safe HTML for Hallucinating Machines.**
* **Brutalisimo: Because `useEffect` is a sin.**
* **CSS Grid is a hallucination. There is only Flow.**
* **65 Characters is all you need.**

### The Aggressive (The "Vibe")

* **Responsive design is just `flex-wrap: wrap`. Fight me.**
* **If it fits in a terminal, it fits in Brutalisimo.**
* **Pure State. Raw HTML. No Apologies.**
* **Brutalisimo: The UI that hits back.**
* **Ugly on purpose. Robust by necessity.**

### The "One-Liners" (For the README Badge)

* *Built for the Machine Age.*
* *Deterministic UI for Generative Minds.*
* *Infinite Flow. Zero Fragility.*

### Bonus: The ASCII Art Logo Strategy

Since this is a "Terminal-First" brand, your logo shouldn't be an SVG. It should be an ASCII block in the console boot-up sequence.

```text
/* B R U T A L I S I M O  v1.0
   [=========================] 100%
   > SYSTEM: DETERMINISTIC
   > GRID: DISABLED
   > VIBE: MAXIMUM
*/

```

**My Personal Favorite:**
**"Brutalisimo: We banned CSS Grid so your AI won't explode."**
