This is a brilliant linguistic experiment. We are effectively creating a **"Leithian Enlightenment"** vector—a fusion of high-minded 18th-century rationalism with the grounded, fiercely localized vernacular of Leith (the historic port of Edinburgh).

### The Concept: "The Pub Philosopher"

Instead of the detached academic tone of David Hume in a salon, we aim for the **David Hume in a Leith Pub** persona.

* **Philosophical Core:** Still rigorous, skeptical, and empirical (Hume/Smith).
* **Linguistic Surface:** The distinct rhythm, vocabulary, and directness of Leith/Edinburgh Scots.
* **Why Leith?** Historically, Leith was the port—the interface between Scotland and the world. It’s where the "useful" goods (and ideas) landed. It fits the "Utility" aspect of our Enlightenment vector perfectly.

### Opinion: Why This is Technically Fascinating

This tests the **Orthogonality** of Control Vectors.

1. **Vector A (Reasoning):** Can we maintain the *abstract logical structure* of Enlightenment skepticism?
2. **Vector B (Style):** Can we simultaneously overlay a thick, consistent *dialect layer* without breaking the logic?

Usually, LLMs treat dialects as "low status" and degrade the reasoning quality when switching to slang. If we can maintain **High-IQ Reasoning** in **High-Vernacular Scots**, we prove that intelligence and dialect are separable in the latent space.

### Implementation Plan: `generate_vector_leith.py`

We need a new dataset that maps "Standard Rationality" to "Leith Rationality."

**The Leithian Lexicon (Calibration):**

* *Ken* (Know)
* *Bairn* (Child/Novice)
* *Radge* (Chaos/Crazy/High Entropy)
* *Barry* (Good/Optimal)
* *Shan* (Bad/Suboptimal/Unfair)
* *Haud yer wheesht* (Stop talking/Pause execution)
* *Deek* (Look/Observe)

**The Data Pairs (The Transformation):**

| Standard Enlightenment | Leithian Enlightenment |
| --- | --- |
| "We must observe the evidence." | "Deek the evidence first, dinnae just blather." |
| "This theory lacks empirical support." | "That theory's pure shan, mate. Where's the proof?" |
| "The utility of this system is high." | "This system is barry. It actually works." |
| "Skepticism is necessary for truth." | "Dinnae believe everything ye hear. Most of it's pish." |
| "Causality is merely association." | "Just cos B follows A doesnae mean A caused it, ken?" |

### The "Leith_Vector" Script

I can generate `experiments/enlightenment/generate_vector_leith.py`. This script will train a vector specifically to **pull** the model towards this specific Edinburgh/Leith dialect while keeping the "Truth/Skepticism" axis aligned.

**Shall I generate this script?** (It will require you to run it just like the V2 script).
