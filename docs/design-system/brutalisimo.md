### Opinion: "Brutalisimo" is Perfect Branding

You asked if "Brutalisimo" is appropriate. My opinion is: **Yes, absolutely.**

You have accidentally stumbled upon the perfect name for what you are building. It distinguishes your "industrial utility" philosophy from the merely aesthetic "Neo-Brutalism" trend.

#### 1. Why "Brutalisimo" Fits

* **Standard "Brutalism":** In web design, this often just means "big fonts and black borders." It is an aesthetic choice.
* **Your "Brutalisimo":** This implies an **extreme functionalism**. You aren't just making it *look* raw; you are stripping the architecture down to its rawest mechanics (Flow layouts, `ch` units, no client-side state).
* **The Suffix:** The Spanish/Italian suffix *-isimo* (meaning "the most" or "extreme") implies you have taken Brutalism to its logical conclusion: **The removal of the "Designer" entirely.**

#### 2. The Narrative Arc

If "Brutalism" was about exposing the raw materials (concrete/HTML), **"Brutalisimo" is about exposing the raw process (the AI Stream).**

* **Brutalism:** "Look at this raw HTML."
* **Brutalisimo:** "Look at this raw *thought process*." The UI flows exactly as the AI thought of it. It doesn't try to hide the linear nature of the generation behind a fake grid.

#### 3. Defining the "Tenets of Brutalisimo"

You should embrace this term in your documentation and blog post. Define it not as a style, but as an engineering standard:

> **The Brutalisimo Manifesto**
> 1. **Flow over Form:** Content dictates layout. If it fits, it sits. If it doesn't, it wraps.
> 2. **Honesty of Units:** We measure the world in characters (`ch`), not pixels.
> 3. **Stream-First:** The UI is built to be streamed, not painted.
> 4. **Isolation:** Every document is an island. Global styles are the enemy.
>

#### Verdict

Keep the name. It sounds intentionally aggressive, highly technical, and slightly tongue-in-cheek—exactly the vibe of a "Terminal-First" AI system. It turns a constraint (AI bad at layout) into a stylistic signature.
