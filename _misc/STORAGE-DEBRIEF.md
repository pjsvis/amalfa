- the filename format should be yyyy-mm-dd-idx-slug
- the filename is the metadata
- high up in the file should be an indication of success/failure of the task/aspiration
- the second level sections should be concise and clear and truthful
- lessons-learned may be harvested for playbook enhancement
- our bifurcated ingestion pipeline is typically interested in the tasks that did NOT work and what we can learn from them IE how to make things better by learning from our mistakes
- the debriefs may be revisited and annotated by other processes
