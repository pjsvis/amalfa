# POLYVIS // MENTATION ENVIRONMENT

> "The medium is the message." — Marshall McLuhan
> "Information is the resolution of uncertainty." — Claude Shannon

## 00. OVERVIEW
This repository contains a single-file operational artifact: **The Polyvis Environment**.

It is not a web page. It is a simulation of **Mentation**: the cognitive process of transforming unstructured "Stuff" into coherent "Things."

The interface demonstrates the brand promise by performatively executing it. The user does not read about the process; they induce it.

## 01. CORE PHILOSOPHY
### The Observer Effect
Clarity is not the default state of the universe; entropy is. Structure requires energy.
* **Idle State:** High Entropy. The system displays raw, uninterpreted data ("Stuff").
* **Active State:** Low Entropy. The user's attention (cursor proximity) acts as the binding energy, collapsing the wave function into a legible identifier ("POLYVIS").

### The Cognitive Cliff
The system is fragile by design. It relies on the continuous application of intent.
* **Proximity Field:** The center 70% of the viewport constitutes the **Coherence Zone**.
* **Catastrophic RTZ:** Retreating to the periphery does not cause a fade-out; it triggers a total structural collapse. The signal is lost. The "Thing" returns to "Stuff."

## 02. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
**Protocol:** `FAFCAS` (Fast As Fudge, Cool As Sugar)

### The Spam Filter (Cognitive Authentication)
This artifact implements a passive-aggressive defense against non-sentient observers (bots).
1.  **No Static Data:** The contact address `whatever@wherever.net` does not exist in the source code.
2.  **Dynamic Injection:** The address is constructed programmatically only when the environment reaches **State 3 (Stable)**.
3.  **The Filter:** To scrape the email, an agent must simulate human curiosity (enter the zone, wait for the wave collapse, maintain position).

## 03. SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
1.  **Injection:** User enters the Coherence Zone.
2.  **Mentation:** The title `...POLYVIS:::` resolves via Right-to-Left deductive sweep (Wait Time: ~1.7s).
3.  **Definition:** The tagline `TURNING STUFF INTO THINGS` fades in.
4.  **Contact:** The communication channel `[ email ]` materializes.

## 04. DEPLOYMENT
This is a **Single-File Artifact**.
1.  Place `index.html` in the root directory.
2.  There are no dependencies.
3.  There are no assets.

## 05. STATUS
`[ SYSTEM_READY ]`
`[ ENTROPY_DETECTED ]`
`[ AWAITING_DEMAND ]`

## 06. THE AFFORDANCE PROTOCOL
We reject the "mailto:" anchor tag as a legacy demand. It forces a context switch and assumes the user's intent.

**Polyvis v1.7** implements a strict **Affordance Protocol**:
* **The Pointer:** Shifts to indicate capability, not obligation.
* **The Action:** Silent extraction. Clicking the email triggers a clipboard write event (`navigator.clipboard`).
* **The Feedback:** A minimal, ephemeral confirmation (`[ ADDRESS_COPIED ]`) that dissolves in 2 seconds.

This approach respects the user's cognitive state. It offers utility without exerting pressure.
