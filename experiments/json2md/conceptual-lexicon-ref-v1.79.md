The input data structures. The transformed output data structures. A detailed analysis of the transformation, including any defaults applied. Confirmation of successful integration with downstream components (e.g., Graphology). A final, simple, text-based or ASCII representation of the end result to prove functionality. 4. **Goal**: To ensure the core logic is robust, debuggable, and validated independently of any UI, reinforcing that our primary product is the processing pipeline itself.
