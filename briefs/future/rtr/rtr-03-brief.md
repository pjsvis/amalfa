### Mentation Report: The Reciprocal Text Refraction (RTR) Brief

**Locus Tag:** `2026-02-09-RTR-HYPOTHESIS-TEST`
**Persona:** Ctx (Scottish Enlightenment / Analytical / Resourceful)

In my opinion, we are at the **"Lightning Strike"** phase. We have successfully transformed "Stuff" (seismic theory and disparate embeddings) into a "Thing" (the RTR Hypothesis). Per **PHI-14 (Architectural Specialisation)**, we must now determine if this modular component serves a single, well-defined purpose that justifies its presence in our stack.

---

### I. The Hypothesis

The **Reciprocal Text Refraction (RTR)** method posits that semantic "Discontinuities" (logical faults, structural breaks, or inconsistent strata) can be identified by treating a document as a seismic medium and measuring the **Reciprocal Gap** between forward and reverse embedding-travel-time traces.

---

### II. The Substrate Requirement

To perform a rigorous test, we cannot rely on a single document. We require a **Random Substrate** to act as our "Weathering Layer".

* **Proposal:** Generate a "Control Substrate" by taking a known, high-structure document (e.g., the **Conceptual Lexicon**) and shuffling its embedding order.
* **Function:** This provides a baseline of "Pure Stuff." A useful RTR method must show a flat response in the 0.5X (Depth) plot for this substrate.

### III. Proposed Test Suite (The "Saudi-Spectrum" Protocols)

#### Test 1: The "Strata Detection" (CDA Verification)

* **Goal:** Can the RTR method detect the transition between different logical sections of the CDA (e.g., PHI to COG)?
* **Procedure:** Run the RTR script on the `CDA_63.json`.
* **Success Metric:** The 0.5X Plot (Depth) should show a distinct "step-change" or "refractor boundary" at the header indices of each section.

#### Test 2: The "Fault Line" Injection (Logic Error Detection)

* **Goal:** Can the RTR method detect a "hidden" logical discontinuity?
* **Procedure:** Take a functional TypeScript file and inject a non-sequitur or a contradictory logic gate in the middle.
* **Success Metric:** The 2X Plot (Velocity) derivative should spike at the exact index of the injection, where the forward context and reverse context fail to meet in vector space.

#### Test 3: The "Reranker Calibration" (Signal Processing)

* **Goal:** Is the Reranker actually required, or is it a "Compulsive Narrative" addition?
* **Procedure:** Compare the raw Embedding RTR results against the RTR results after a Reranker "De-noising" pass on the suspected fault zones.
* **Success Metric:** If the Reranker significantly reduces the "false positive" spikes in the depth plot, it is a necessary component for the "Things" filter.

### IV. Determining Utility: The "Go/No-Go" Matrix

| Utility Metric | Success Condition (Pursue) | Failure Condition (Discard) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sensitivity** | Detects a 1-token logic flip in a 1000-line file. | Requires massive changes to "refract." |
| **Computability** | Runs in O(n) time within Bun-TS. | Becomes computationally heavier than the LLM. |
| **Uniqueness** | Identifies errors that standard "Forward Reading" LLMs miss. | Just duplicates existing "Perplexity" checks. |

### V. Ctx Opinion: The "Bedrock" Outlook

This idea is **highly useful** because it treats **Workflow Durability** as a physical property of the data. If the "Forward" and "Reverse" logic of a process do not meet at the geophone, the process is not durable.

By using the **Reciprocal Method**, we aren't just reading; we are performing an **Integrity Audit**. In the age of AI-generated hallucination, a method that uses reciprocal geometry to find "Bedrock" is a defensive necessity.

### Next Objective

Shall we execute **Test 1** (The Strata Detection) using the **Bun-Typescript** environment and the `conceptual-lexicon-ref-v1.79.json` embeddings? I can provide the refined logic for the `0.5X` and `2X` functions now.
