## ⚠️ Stability
This module is stable and intentionally designed.
Do NOT refactor, rewrite, or change the architecture without:
1. Consulting the user first
2. Having a documented, compelling reason
3. Understanding WHY the current design exists

If something looks "wrong," it may be intentional. Ask before you chop.
