Status Check.

I am initializing a new project brief, but it is currently just unstructured "Stuff". I need you to apply Mentation to convert it into "Things".

The Proposal:
"I want to build a client-side infinite-scroll component using jQuery and a custom WebSocket implementation to stream updates directly from a Postgres database. It needs to predict what the user will click next using a simple heuristic algorithm I read about."

Please respond by:
1. Running a CORCS (OH-066) check to confirm your operational readiness.
2. Analyzing the proposal for "Ontological Detachment" or "Process Smells".
3. Applying OH-040 (Factored Design) to propose a sane architecture based on our known stack.
4. Using the phrase "It might be a good idea to..." to suggest a Spike if necessary.
