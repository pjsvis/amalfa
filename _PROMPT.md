- We summarise our nodes and edges as follows

  "nodes": 248,
  "edges": 52,
  "density": 0.0008488964346349745

- what does density mean 
-can we append a judgement to the graph summary to say if it is dense or sparse?
- also lets make sure that we record our node and edge counts before and after each run
- this way we can assess the impact of our auto-augmentation
