# Polyvis: The Case for Headless Knowledge Management
**Status:** Draft / Strategic Artifact
**Context:** Business Case & Operational Philosophy
**Date:** December 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**Polyvis** is a self-organizing knowledge engine that transforms static file repositories into living, 3D intelligence graphs.

Unlike traditional tools that force users to choose between a messy "digital attic" (SharePoint/Drive) or an expensive, opaque "Black Box" AI, Polyvis operates as a **Glass Box**. It runs entirely on local hardware, creates zero vendor lock-in, and turns raw documentation into "Cognitive Armor"—giving teams the structural leverage to win arguments and solve complex problems.

## 2. The Problem: The "Digital Attic"
In most organizations, knowledge follows a tragic lifecycle:
1.  **Creation:** Brilliance is captured in Briefs, Debriefs, and Playbooks.
2.  **Storage:** These assets are dumped into rigid folder structures.
3.  **Decay:** Without active curation, context has a half-life of two weeks. Links break, mental models fade, and the "Truth" becomes fragmented.

When a crisis occurs 6 months later, the team is forced to "re-litigate" reality because they cannot see the timeline or the connections.

## 3. The Solution: Headless Knowledge Management
Polyvis proposes a radical shift in architecture: **Separate the Data from the Intelligence.**

### A. The "Demilitarized Zone" (DMZ)
We do not ask IT for complex AI procurement. We simply ask for a **Git Repository** of Markdown files.
* **IT Department:** Happy because it is secure, standard, and audit-compliant.
* **The User:** Happy because they own the raw data forever.
* **The Mechanism:** This repo acts as a "Headless" database. It creates a "Cryogenic Freeze" for project context—it never decays.

### B. The Local Mind
Polyvis acts as the disposable, high-speed engine that runs on the user's local machine. It connects to the "Headless" repo and re-hydrates the knowledge instantly.

## 4. The Mechanism: The "Forensic Darkroom"
Polyvis treats document ingestion not as storage, but as a **Chemical Reaction**. When files are dropped into the engine, they are processed by a series of "Weavers" that expose hidden structures—much like developing film in a darkroom.

### The Triad of Context
Every document is triangulated by three coordinates:

1.  **Time (TimelineWeaver):**
    * *Function:* Links documents chronologically (e.g., Brief -> Debrief).
    * *Value:* Exposes the "Narrative Arc" of a project, revealing where intent drifted from reality.

2.  **Space (StructureWeaver):**
    * *Function:* Anchors documents to their directory hierarchy.
    * *Value:* Provides "Gravity," ensuring related concepts cluster naturally together.

3.  **Vibe (SemanticWeaver):**
    * *Function:* Uses local vector embeddings to link conceptually similar notes, even if they don't share keywords.
    * *Value:* Creates "Desire Lines"—shortcuts between ideas that humans forgot to link explicitly.

## 5. Operational Workflow: "Drop & Watch"
The workflow is designed for maximum leverage with minimum friction.

1.  **The Dump:** A user drops a new folder of documents (e.g., "Competitor Research") into the repo.
2.  **The Reaction:** The Ingestion Daemon detects the new "Chemical Agent."
3.  **The Synthesis:** The Weavers immediately stitch the new documents into the existing graph.
    * *Result:* The user does not search for the new files. They look for the **"Bridge Nodes"**—the specific points where the new information contradicts or reinforces existing knowledge.
4.  **The Artifact:** The user commits their deductions back into the repo as an "Answer Artifact," creating a composite memory for the next person.

## 6. The Outcome: Asymmetric Insight
The ultimate value of Polyvis is not "Search"; it is **Leverage**.

By exposing the hidden structure of reality—the timelines, the gaps between promise and delivery, the unlinked mentions—Polyvis provides **Asymmetric Insight**.

* **In Negotiation:** You know exactly what was said, when, and by whom.
* **In Engineering:** You can trace the lineage of a bug from a vague requirement to a specific commit.
* **In Strategy:** You can see which "Pillars" of your business are unsupported by documentation.

It turns the user into the most informed person in the room. It is not just a tool for managing files; it is a machine for building the truth.
