# Playbook: The Resonance Inference Protocol
**Status:** Active
**Context:** Forensic Analysis / Due Diligence
**Metaphor:** The Evidence Board

## 1. Establishing the Timeline
The first step in any investigation is establishing the "Spine of Time."
* **Technique:** Run the `TimelineWeaver`.
* **Inference:** Look for "Temporal Friction"—where a Debrief describes a reality that contradicts the timeline established in the original Brief.
* **Question:** "What was known on [Date X] that was ignored on [Date Y]?"

## 2. Bucket-to-Bucket Connectivity (The Bridge)
When adding a new "Bucket" of documents to an existing set, we look for the "Chemical Reaction."
* **Technique:** Use `DesireLineWeaver` to find unlinked mentions between `Collection A` and `Collection B`.
* **Inference:** Identify "Bridge Nodes"—the specific files that act as the only physical or semantic connection between two disparate topics.
* **Question:** "Does this new information validate or invalidate the assumptions in our core Playbooks?"

## 3. Gap Analysis (The Triangle of Truth)
We audit the relationship between Intent, Execution, and Documentation.
* **Technique:** Query the `standard_reports/gaps.md`.
* **Inference:** High-centrality "Brief" nodes with no "Debrief" edges indicate abandoned intent. High-centrality "Debrief" nodes with no "Reference" edges indicate undocumented knowledge (Tribal Knowledge).
* **Question:** "What are we doing that we haven't written down, and what did we promise that we haven't done?"
