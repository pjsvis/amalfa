# Debriefs

Reflective documents capturing learnings from completed work.

## What is a Debrief?

A **debrief** is written immediately after completing a brief. It captures:

- What worked (successful approaches)
- What failed (dead ends, mistakes)
- Lessons learned (generalizable insights)
- Open questions (future investigation)

## Purpose

Convert experience into explicit knowledge. Debriefs feed into playbooks.

## Workflow

1. Complete brief
2. Write debrief (use template)
3. Amalfa auto-augments (tags, links, clusters)
4. Extract lessons → update playbooks

## Template

See: `docs/VISION-AGENT-LEARNING.md` for full debrief template and workflow.
