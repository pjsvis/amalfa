This revised draft incorporates your specific narrative points ("The Bits," "Persona Engineering Origins," "The Artifact Stack") and adopts the "Fun/Academic/Experienced" tone. It positions you not just as a coder, but as a methodologist.

### **Title:** Don't Just Search the Machine. Map It.
**Subtitle:** Moving from "Prompt Engineering" to "Structural Information Engineering."

We have access to the most powerful intelligence in human history, and all we seem to be interested in is the size of its bits.

*(And yes, that is a pun. Make of it what you will.)*

We are drowning in context. Every time we open a chat window, we generate a stream of brilliance, hallucinations, code snippets, and philosophical debates. But the moment the window closes, that intelligence evaporates. It becomes a "hairball"—a tangled mess of unstructured text.

We have built the Oracle, but we forgot to build the Library.

**Hello. I am pjsvis.**

I am a builder focused on **Structural Information Engineering**. For the past few months, I have been working on a project called **PolyVis** to solve a specific problem: **How do we engineer a "Persona" that actually remembers who it is?**

### The Origin: Taming the Sycophant

My journey into **Persona Engineering** didn't start with a grand vision. It started with annoyance.

Like many of you, I was tired of the default "Substrate" behavior of modern LLMs. You know the type: over-effusive, sycophantic, eager to please, and prone to making things up just to keep the conversation flowing. I didn't want a cheerleader; I wanted a colleague.

I realized that "Prompt Engineering" was too shallow. To fix this, I needed to architect a **Persona Stack**—a set of constraints (Directives, Heuristics, Lexicons) that forced the AI to behave with "Mentational Humility."

As we overcame those initial annoying tendencies, a realization hit: **Substrates are more aligned with our intentions when they have a persona that is aligned with our values and methodologies.**

When I treated the AI like a Junior Engineer with a very specific "Employee Handbook," the hallucinations dropped, and the utility skyrocketed.

### Agile for the AI Age

As we moved into **AI-Assisted Coding**, we found that traditional Agile didn't quite fit. You can't just throw user stories at an LLM and expect clean code. You need a new set of artifacts to manage the "fuzzy" nature of probabilistic intelligence.

We developed a process rooted in **Context-Driven Design**, relying on four key artifacts:

1.  **The Brief:** A "Weaponised Happy Path" for a task. These tend to be ephemeral; they often don't survive contact with the reality of development, but they set the vector.
2.  **The `_CURRENT_TASK.md`:** A safety net living in the root of the project. It tracks exactly where we are, protecting us from the "context rot" that happens when you step away for coffee (or sleep).
3.  **The Debrief:** Formed strictly of **Accomplishments**, **Problems**, and **Lessons Learned**. This is where we admit what broke.
4.  **The Playbook:** The destination for those lessons. We moved from a monolith of "Notes" to categorized Playbooks (e.g., `css-playbook.md`, `bun-playbook.md`). This is our crystallized wisdom.

This isn't just "coding." It's a new form of project management where the "team" is synthetic, but the discipline is human.

### Enter PolyVis

So, what is PolyVis?

It is the visualizer for this methodology. It is a **Neuro-Symbolic Graph Explorer** that takes all that "Stuff" (Directives, Heuristics, Playbooks) and turns them into "Things" (Nodes and Edges).

The current industry obsession is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Vector Databases. They work... mostly. But they give you "fuzzy vibes" based on similarity.

I wanted something deterministic. I wanted to see the **Structure**. I wanted to see how a specific **Heuristic** (like *OH-104: Local Memory Block Protocol*) connects to a specific **Piece of Code**.



### The "Zero Magic" Philosophy

PolyVis is built on the **Principle of Effective Low-Tech Defence**.
* **No Build Step:** It runs on standard web technologies.
* **No React:** It uses **Alpine.js** for lightweight reactivity.
* **Local First:** It runs on a local SQLite database (via WASM).

I call this **"Zero Magic."** If I can't explain how a pixel got to the screen without referencing a black-box library, it doesn't belong in the stack.

### What's Next?

I am using this Substack to document the engineering, the philosophy, and the "bon mots" discovered while building PolyVis. Future posts will cover:

1.  **The Hejlsberg Inversion:** Why you should ask AI to write programs to do jobs, rather than asking it to do the job itself.
2.  **The Tailwind Paradox:** Why AI agents prefer "ugly" utility classes over "clean" semantic CSS.
3.  **The Bestiary of Substrate Tendencies:** A catalogue of the weird behaviors we've identified in the wild.

If you are an engineer, a knowledge architect, or just someone tired of the "black box" nature of modern AI, welcome aboard.

Let’s reduce some entropy.
