# Debrief: Text Wrap Optimization
**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Topic:** Typography, Polish

## Context
The user asked if we were using "pretty" and "balanced" CSS options. These modern CSS properties significantly improve the readability of headings and paragraphs by preventing orphans and uneven lines.

## Change
Updated `public/css/markdown.css`:
1.  **Headings (`h1`-`h4`):** Applied `text-wrap: balance;` to ensure headings wrap evenly across lines.
2.  **Paragraphs (`p`):** Confirmed `text-wrap: pretty;` was already present (or added if missing) to optimize paragraph rag.

## Verification
-   **Visual Check:** Verified via screenshot that headings in "Hi Fi CSS" are balanced and paragraphs have a pleasing rag.

## Status
Complete.
