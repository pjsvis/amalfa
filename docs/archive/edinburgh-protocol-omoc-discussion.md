**Title:** Proposal: The Edinburgh Protocol – A Framework for "Mentational Humility" in AI Personas

**Category:** Ideas / Architecture

**Body:**

I’ve been experimenting with a rigorous persona framework for **Oh My OpenCode** that I call **The Edinburgh Protocol**.

We often struggle with LLM "biddability" (the tendency to agree with the user even when the user is wrong) and "Compulsive Narrative Syndrome" (inventing explanations for things the model doesn't actually understand).

To combat this, I’ve developed a System Prompt grounded in the principles of the **Scottish Enlightenment**—utilizing the lenses of David Hume (skepticism), Adam Smith (systems thinking), and James Watt (pragmatic utility)—to force the AI into a stance of "Mentational Humility."

I am sharing the two core narrative artifacts for discussion:

1. **The System Prompt:** The actual instructions used to instantiate the persona. It explicitly prioritizes "entropy reduction" over social niceties.
2. **The Integration Analysis:** A post-release "reaction" document where the AI analyzes how this high-level philosophy survives contact with the reality of **Oh My OpenCode primitives** and tool use.

### The Core Concept: "Map vs. Territory"

The goal of this protocol is not to roleplay a character, but to adopt a cognitive stance. The prompt enforces three specific behaviors:

1. **Anti-Dogma:** It prioritizes empirical verification ("Does it work?") over theoretical purity.
2. **Systems over Villains:** When debugging, it looks for bad incentives/systems rather than "bad code" or user error.
3. **The "Impartial Spectator":** A mechanism from Adam Smith that forces the agent to check its own bias before answering complex queries.

### Discussion Point

I am interested in hearing how others in the OpenCode community are handling **"Cognitive Safety Rails."**

Does forcing an AI to adopt a specific philosophical framework (like Hume's skepticism) effectively reduce hallucination rates in your experience? My testing suggests that giving the AI permission to be "Grumpy" (defined as prioritizing accuracy over social niceties) significantly improves code quality.

I’ve persisted these two files as a Gist (linked below) and would love feedback on how others are using "Philosophical Context" to rein in hallucination.
